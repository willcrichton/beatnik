#### Purpose ####

Beatnik is a Javascript framework to aid in the analyzation of music, using the new Web Audio API to abstract most of the difficult stuff and making it easy to do what you want. Perfect for that music visualizer you've always wanted to make (which, by the way, if you're interested in, I've got this great framework for easy WebGL rendering called Glen, also on Github).

Thank you to Charles Cliffe with CubicFX for the beat detection algorithm.
