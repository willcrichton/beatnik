beatnik
========

#### Purpose ####
Beatnik is a Javascript framework to aid in the analyzation/processing of music. It uses the new Web Audio API to abstract most of the difficult stuff and makes it easy to do what you want. Perfect for that music visualizer you've always wanted to make (which, by the way, if you're interested in, I've got this great framework for easy WebGL rendering called Glen, also on Github).

#### Features ####
* XMLHttpRequest loading of music and impulse responses
* Play/stop functionality
* Access to FFT Table
* Beat detection (needs improvement)
* Song information: current position, total duration
* Volume control
* Speed control
* Impulse responses: applying sound effects (e.g. talking in a concert hall or underwater)
* 3D Spatialization: positioning sound in 3D space relative to listener (e.g. hearing it from top or left)

#### Credits ####
Thank you to Charles Cliffe with CubicFX for the beat detection algorithm.
